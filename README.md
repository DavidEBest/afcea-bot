# :car: Motorized Sumobot :blue_car:

This is the Norfolk.js motorized version of [Pawel's Sumobot-jr](https://github.com/makenai/sumobot-jr/blob/master/README.md) design that we put together for [NodeBots Day 2016](https://github.com/nodebots/nodebotsday). The main change was to the laser-cut side pieces to support gear motors (inspired by [Markus's sumobot](https://github.com/ghtomcat/sumobot)) and the laser-cut wheels have been replaced by rubber wheels. To make this beginner-friendly, we use a motor shield for wiring the motors to the arduino. However, the bot chassis design can support other motor drivers and wiring strategies.
